## Description ✍🏻

For this week's assignment, I am creating a website using React that integrates CRUD functionality. The website enables users to filter their categories and carry out operations like creating, editing, and deleting categories.

## Installation 🔨

In order to install and develop locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository

```bash

```

2. install required dependencies

```bash
